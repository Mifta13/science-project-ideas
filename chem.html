<h1 class="text-center">How to Make a Potato Battery</h1>
&nbsp;
<h2 class="text-center">Think chemical energy is dull? Think again with this cool project that lets you turn a potato into a battery.
</h2>
<div class="b"><h3>Potato Battery Instructions</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<div>
<p>This potato battery is a great activity to discuss the transfer of energy, from chemical to electrical energy. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to complete from start to finish.
</p>
</div>

&nbsp;
<div class="b"><h3>Materials</h3></div>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div><ul style="line-height: 1.7">
    <li><p>Two potatoes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Knife</p></li>
<li><p>Two copper wires</p></li>
<li><p>Two pennies</p></li>
<li><p>Two galvanized nails</p></li>
<li><p>Multimeter with one black wire probe and one red wire probe</p></li>



</ul>
</div>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="b"><h3>Directions</h3></div>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<ul><li><p>
Cut out a penny-sized hole inside of a raw potato.</p></li>

<li><p>
Strip one end of a copper wire.</p></li>

<li><p>Tie a copper wire around a penny, making sure the stripped end is touching the copper. You should wrap the wire around the penny a few times.</p></li>

<li><p>Place the penny and copper wire unit in the hole of your potato.</p></li>

<li><p>Pierce the potato with a galvanized nail, in the opposite side of the potato as the penny.</p></li>

<li><p>Do the same thing with another potato, penny, copper wire, and galvanized nail.</p></li>

<li><p>Place the two potatoes side by side.</p></li>

<li><p>Wrap the copper wire from one potato around the galvanized nail of the other potato.</p></li>

</ul>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="b"><h3>Does Your Battery Work?</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>So now you've made your potato battery, but what should you do with it? There are a variety of things you can do to see if your battery works and how it might be used.
</p>
&nbsp;
<ul>
    <li><p>Use a Multimeter - A multimeter measures voltage - so you can measure voltage by touching the multimeter's probes to the nail or penny.</p></li>
<li><p>Use your potato to power something. You can use LED lights, a light bulb, a simple clock, or anything else small that requires a battery. Keep in mind a potato battery isn't strong enough to power anything large. This is easiest to do if you use alligator clips to help connect your battery to the battery terminal of a small device.</p></li>

</ul>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="b"><h3>Variations</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>There are a few variations you can try with this experiment. All of them are appropriate for any age. However, small children will require adult help.
</p>
&nbsp;
<ul>
    <li><p>Add more potatoes (with pennies and galvanized nails in them) to increase your voltage, by attaching the potatoes to each other with copper wires (see video).</p></li>
<li><p>Try boiling or cooking the potato first to see if this increases the output or voltage.
</p></li>
<li><p>Try the experiment with a lemon or an orange.
</p></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="b"><h3>Why It Works</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>The reason potato batteries work is because chemical reactions are taking place, and changing chemical energy into electric energy. Teach Engineering notes that potatoes create an electrolyte solution. This means they provide electrons with a place to move to copper and zinc (and back to copper) to complete circuits. The potato itself acts as a buffer between the copper and zinc during electron transfers.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="b"><h3>Learning About Electricity</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>The potato battery experiment provides an excellent way for kids (and adults) to learn more about science. Now that you've made a potato battery, you know more about how a circuit and electricity works.</p>

<h2 style="padding-left: 5px;">Learn how to make a wave bottle.</h2>
<p>Learn how to make a wave bottle using oil, water, and a secret ingredient that makes the whole thing fizz, bubble, and erupt.</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="r"><h3>Experiment</h3></div>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "c2.webp"></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>1</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Fill the bottle three-quarters full with vegetable oil.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "c3.webp" >
</div>
&nbsp;
<h3>2</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Fill the rest of the bottle with water (almost to the top but not overflowing).</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "c4.webp"></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>3</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Add about ten drops of food coloring. Be sure to make the water fairly dark in color. Notice that the food coloring only colors the water and not the oil.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "c5.webp"></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>4</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Divide the Alka-Seltzer tablet into four pieces.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "c6.webp">
</div>
&nbsp;
<h3>5</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Drop one of the tiny pieces of Alka-Seltzer into the oil and water mixture. Watch
what happens. When the bubbling stops, add another chunk of Alka-Seltzer.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "c7.webp"></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>6</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>When you have used up all of the Alka-Seltzer and the bubbling has completely stopped, screw on the soda bottle cap. Tip the bottle back and forth and watch the wave appear. The tiny droplets of liquid join together to make one big wavelike blob.</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="r"><h3>How It Works</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>First of all, you confirmed what you already know—oil and water do not mix. Even if you try to shake up the bottle, the oil breaks up into small little drops, but it doesn’t mix with the water. Why is it that oil and water are such opposites?
</p>
<p>Oil and water don’t mix because of how their molecules are constructed. Water is what is known as a <em>polar molecule</em>. A water molecule is shaped like a V, with an oxygen atom at the bottom point of the V and a hydrogen atom on each of the two top ends. However, there is unequal sharing of electrons between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. This means that the bottom of the molecule has a negative electrical charge, while the top carries a positive charge.
</p>
<p>Vegetable oil, on the other hand, is a <em>nonpolar molecule</em> made of long chains of hydrocarbons—strings of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms. Unlike the water molecule, there is equal sharing of electrons between the carbon and hydrogen atoms. This means that the electrical charges of the atoms are not separated, so the molecules don’t have opposite positive and negative ends.
</p>
<p>If you were to think of molecules like groups of people, the polar molecules hang out with other polar molecules, and the nonpolar molecules with other nonpolar molecules. This brings us back to the reason why oil and water don’t mix. Water is a polar molecule, and it just doesn’t hang out with nonpolar molecules like oil. Scientists say that oil and water are <em>immiscible</em>.
</p>
<p>The adage “like dissolves like” will help you remember what will mix with what. Salt and water mix because both molecules are polar—like dissolves like. It’s also easy to mix vegetable oil and olive oil, or motor oil and peanut oil . . . but that’s gross.
</p>
<p>You also noticed that food coloring only mixes with water . . . and now you know why. Food coloring is a polar molecule because it dissolves in water. In other words, food coloring and water are <em>miscible</em>. Vegetable oil is not affected by the food coloring because they are polar opposites.
</p>
<p>Here’s the surprising part . . . the Alka-Seltzer tablet reacts with the water to make tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide. These bubbles attach themselves to the blobs of colored water and cause them to float to the surface. When the bubbles pop, the color blobs sink back to the bottom of the bottle, and the whole thing starts over until the Alka-Seltzer is used up. When the chemical reaction between the Alka-Seltzer and water is over and the bubbling stops, you’re left with a cool looking wave bottle that will sit proudly on your desk.
