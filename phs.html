<h3>1</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Measure 8 ounces of each type of liquid into the seven plastic cups. Depending on the size of the glass cylinder, you might need more or less of each liquid—8 ounces is just a good starting point. You may want to color the corn syrup and the rubbing alcohol with a few drops of food coloring to create a more dramatic effect in your column. Here is the order of layers starting from the bottom and working your way to the top:</p>
<p class="text-center">Honey</p>
<p class="text-center">Corn Syrup</p>
<p class="text-center">Dish Soap</p>
<p class="text-center">Water</p>
<p class="text-center">Vegetable oil</p>
   <p class="text-center">Rubbing alcohol</p>
   <p class="text-center">Lamp oil</p>
   &nbsp;
   <div class="text-center"><img src= "p2.webp"></div>
   &nbsp;
   <h3>2</h3>
   &nbsp;
   <p>Start your column by pouring the honey into the cylinder. It is very important to pour the liquids carefully into the center of the cylinder. Make sure the honey does not touch the sides of the cylinder while you are pouring. It’s important to let each layer settle before adding the next one. Take your time and pour slowly and carefully.</p>
   &nbsp;
   <div class="text-center"><img src="p3.webp"></div>
   &nbsp;
   <h3>3</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>The next layer is corn syrup. Again, try not to let the corn syrup touch the sides of the container as you’re pouring. The key is to pour slowly and evenly.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src="p4.webp"></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>4</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Repeat the same procedure with the dish soap. Pour the soap directly into the middle of the layer of corn syrup . . . and take your time pouring!
</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src="p5.webp"></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>5</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Stop for just a second to enjoy your success. You’re almost halfway to your goal of stacking seven layers of liquid. The next liquid is water, and you’ll need to use the food baster—it’s like a giant medicine dropper for food. From this point forward, it’s okay to let the liquids touch the sides of the cylinder. In fact, it’s a must! Dip the tip of the food baster in the cup of water, squeeze the bulb, and draw up some water. Rest the tip of the food baster on the inside wall of the cylinder and slowly squeeze the bulb. Let the water slowly trickle down the glass to create the next layer. Take your time!</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src="p6.webp"></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>6</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>You’ll use the food baster once again for the next layer—vegetable oil. Use the inside wall of the cylinder to let the vegetable oil slowly trickle down and form the next layer.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src="p7.webp"></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>7</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Wash the food baster with some soap and water in the sink before moving on to the rubbing alcohol. If you have not already colored the rubbing alcohol, use a couple drops of food coloring to make sure this layer isn’t confused with water. Use the food baster and the inside wall of the cylinder to add this next layer.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src="p8.webp"></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>8</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>You’re one layer away from success. Again, rinse the food baster in the sink before moving on to the lamp oil. Since lamp oil is flammable, you must do this last step away from any open flames. Use the food baster to draw up some lamp oil, which has a low surface tension and easily leaks out of the food baster. Keep your finger over the tip as you transport it over to the cylinder. By now you’re a pro at this. Use the baster and the inside wall of the cylinder to slowly add the final liquid layer.

&nbsp;
<p>Woohoo!! You’ve made a seven-layer science burrito, so to speak.
</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="v"><h3 style="color: white">How It Works</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>The science secret here is <em>density</em>. Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given unit volume (density = mass divided by volume). If mass is a measure of how much “stuff” there is in an object or liquid, density is a measure of how tightly that “stuff” is packed together.
Based on this density equation (Density = Mass ÷ Volume), if the weight (or mass) of something increases but the volume stays the same, the density has to go up. Likewise, if the mass decreases but the volume stays the same, the density has to go down. Lighter liquids (like water or rubbing alcohol) are less dense or have less “stuff” packed into them than heavier liquids (like honey or corn syrup).
Every liquid has a density number associated with it. Water, for example, has a density of 1.0 g/cm3 (grams per cubic centimeter—another way to say this is g/mL, which is grams per milliliter). Here are the densities of the liquids used in the column, as well as other common liquids:</p>
&nbsp;
<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
    <tr>
        <th><p>MATERIAL</p></th>
        <th><p>DENSITY (g/cm3 or g/mL)</p></th>
    </tr>
<tr>
    <td><p>Rubbing alcohol</p></td>
    <td><p>0.79</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><p>Lamp oil (refined kerosene)</p></td>
<td><p>0.81</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><p>Baby oil</p></td>
<td><p>0.83</p></td>

<tr>
    <td><p>Vegetable oil</p></td>

    <td><p>Ice cube</p></td>
<td><p>0.92</p></td>

    <td><p>Water</p></td>

    <td><p>Milk</p></td>

    <td><p>Light corn syrup</p></td>

    <td><p>Maple Syrup</p></td>
<td><p>1.37</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><p>Honey</p></td>
<td><p>1.42</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
&nbsp;
<p>The numbers in the table are based on data from manufacturers of each item. Densities may vary from brand to brand. You’ll notice that according to the number, rubbing alcohol should float on top of the lamp oil, but we know from our experiment that the lamp oil is the top layer. Chemically speaking, lamp oil is nothing more than refined kerosene with coloring and fragrance added. Does every brand of lamp oil exhibit the same characteristics? Sounds like the foundation of a great science fair project.
So, the next time you’re enjoying a glass of iced tea, you’ll know why those ice cubes float. That’s right . . . it’s all about density.</p>

<h1 class="text-center" style="padding-top: 50px">Crush a Plastic Bottle</h1>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "i1.jpg"></div>
&nbsp;
<p>Here’s another super simple experiment that almost seems magical, but it works because of air pressure. Even though most of the time you can’t see or feel it, the air around us is pushes against every surface.</p>
<p>But by following the instructions for this science experiment you can watch as the plastic bottle is crushed by the air around it.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="g"><h3>Supplies Needed</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<ul>
    <li><p>Empty 2 liter plastic bottle with lid</p></li>
<li><p>6-8 cups of Ice</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 cup Boiling Water</p></li>
<li><p>8×11 pan</p></li>
<li><p>Pitcher of Ice Water</p></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<div class="g"><h3>Experiment Instructions</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "i2.jpg"></div>
&nbsp;
<h2>Step 1 -</h2>
<p>Begin by filling your 8×11 pan with ice.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "i3.jpg"></div>
&nbsp;
<h2>Step 2-</h2>
<p>Next, pour 1/2 cup of Boiling Water into the 2 liter bottle. After the water is in the bottle, wait for 2 minutes.
</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "i4.jpg"></div>
&nbsp;
<h2>Step 3-</h2>
<p>After two minutes have passed, put the lid back on the bottle. Make sure that it is tight.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "i5.jpg"></div>
&nbsp;
<h2>Step 4-</h2>
<p>Lay the bottle on it’s side in the pan full of ice.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "i6.jpg"></div>
&nbsp;
<h2>Step 5-</h2>
<p>Slowly pour the pitcher of ice water onto the bottle.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src= "i7.jpg"></div>
&nbsp;
<h2>Step 6-</h2>
<p>Stand the bottle up and observe what happens. The plastic bottle has been crushed in.</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="g"><h3>How Does the Experiment Work?</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>Once the hot boiling water was placed in the bottle, it heated up the air inside the bottle. When we put the cap on the bottle, the hot air was trapped inside.</p>
<p>When we then placed the bottle in the ice and poured the cold water on it, the air inside the bottle began to cool down. Cool air exerts less pressure than hot air, therefore the air pressure inside the bottle because to decrease.
</p>
<p>The air pressure inside that bottle bottle decreased to the point where it was less than the air pressure outside the bottle. Therefore the pushing in was greater than the pressure pushing out, causing the bottle to be crushed.
