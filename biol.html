<h1 class="text-center">Extract DNA from a Strawberry</h1>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="s"><h3>What it does</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>In order to study DNA, scientists have to extract it from cells. There are many DNA extraction kits available for scientists to use in the lab, but they all work in roughly the same way. This experiment lets you make your own DNA extraction kit from common household materials. You will extract DNA from strawberries and see the clumps of DNA strands.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="text-center"><img src="b1.gif"></div>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="s"><h3>What you need</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 <li><p>Rubbing alcohol</p></li>
<li><p>Small bowl</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p></li>
<li><p>1/3 cup water</p></li>
<li><p>1 Tablespoon dishwashing detergent (such as Dawn)</p></li>
<li><p>3 strawberries (green tops removed)</p></li>
<li><p>Small plastic zip-top bag</p></li>
<li><p>Funnel Cheesecloth (or a coffee filter)</p></li>
<li><p>Tall drinking glass</p></li>
<li><p>Test tube or small clear glass jar</p></li>
<li><p>Bamboo skewer (optional)</p></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<div class="s"><h3>What to do</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><p>Put the rubbing alcohol in the freezer to chill it while you prepare the rest of the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix the salt, water and detergent in a small bowl. This will be your extraction liquid.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the strawberries in the plastic bag and squeeze out all the extra air before sealing tightly.</p></li>
<li><p>Mash the strawberries with your hands for about 2 minutes until they are mushy.</p></li>
<li><p>Add 3 tablespoons of the extraction liquid to the strawberries in the bag. Squeeze out the air and seal the bag again.</p></li>
<li><p>Mash the strawberry mixture with your hands for another minute.</p></li>
<li><p>Place a layer of cheesecloth inside the funnel and set the funnel on top of the tall drinking glass (so that it will empty into the glass).</p></li>
<li><p>Pour the strawberry mixture from the bag into the funnel. Let it drop through the cheesecloth until there is no liquid left.</p></li>
<li><p>Throw away the cheesecloth and the strawberry pulp inside it.</p></li>
<li><p>Pour the contents of the glass into the test tube or small jar until it is 1/4 full.</p></li>
<li><p>Tilt the test tube or jar and very slowly pour rubbing alcohol down the side. The alcohol will form a layer on top of the strawberry juice. Do not let the alcohol mix with the strawberry juice!
</p></li>
<li><p>Let the contents sit for a few minutes. You should see stringy, whitish stuff collecting between the two layers of liquid. This is DNA! You can gently pull the DNA out with the bamboo skewer if you want.
</p></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<div class="s"><h3>What it's all about</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>The detergent you used caused the cells to pop open, or “lyse.” This releases the DNA into the solution. The alcohol causes the DNA to precipitate out of the solution.</p>
<p>Strawberries are easy to use in this experiment because they are easy to mash and they contain a lot of DNA in each cell. However, you can do this experiment on most any living (or formerly living) thing. Try this experiment using other fruits and vegetables or soft meats (like chicken liver).</p>

<h1 class="text-center">A Science Fair Project on Tooth Decay</h1>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p>
Healthy teeth are vital when you chew food, which is important for digestion. They make it easier for our mouths to form words and – let's not forget – they make radiant smiles. Because teeth are so important, tooth decay can be a serious problem. A science fair project provides an opportunity to demonstrate how tooth decay happens and how to prevent it. You'll need to create many samples for this project, and you probably don't have a collection of teeth for them. Don't worry. Eggshells are a great substitute, and you can get as many of those as you need.
</p>
<div class="t"><h3>CAUSES OF TOOTH DECAY</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>You've probably heard that sweet foods are a major cause of tooth decay, but that leads to two important questions with demonstrable answers. The first question is "Does the sugar in these foods cause the decay or is it something else?" The second question is "How do you prevent decay? "</p>
<p>To answer the first question, soak eggshells in a variety of solutions that may or may not cause decay. Eggshells are a good substitute for teeth because they are made from chemicals similar to those that form tooth enamel. You can choose the solutions based on what you think are the most likely causes of decay, but one of the solutions should be pure sugar water, because you specifically want to know if sugar is the culprit. Here are some other possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cola</p></li>
<li><p>Mineral water
</p></li>
<li><p>Lemonade</p></li>
<li><p>Milk
</p></li>
<li><p>Vinegar</p></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p>Let the samples sit for a week and then note the condition of the eggshells and write down the results.</p>
<p>You'll probably notice that the eggshells that soaked in cola and vinegar are the most affected. In fact, there may be nothing left of them. On the other hand, the eggshells in mineral water and sugar water are mostly unaffected, while those in lemonade and milk may or may not show signs of decay.
</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="t"><h3>THE EXPLANATION</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>Dentists warn about sweet foods because sugar feeds bacteria living in a layer of plaque on the surface of tooth enamel. These bacteria create acids through their metabolism, and it's the acids that cause decay.</p>
<p>Cola contains phosphoric acid, and vinegar contains acetic acid. Both acids are concentrated enough to soften and partially dissolve eggshells. Sugar water and mineral water aren't acidic, so the eggshells in these liquids should be unaffected. Lemonade contains citric acid, and milk contains lactic acid, but these are less concentrated than the acids in cola and vinegar, so you may or may not see damage to the eggshells immersed in these liquids.</p>
<p>As a follow-up, you might let the eggshells in the milk and lemonade sit for a while longer to see how long it takes for them to show signs of decay.</p>
&nbsp;
<div class="t"><h3>PREVENTING DECAY</h3></div>
&nbsp;
<p>Besides cleaning your teeth regularly, is there any way to prevent decay? Dentists recommend fluoride, but does it really help? Find out for yourself with eggshells and two jars filled with vinegar. Coat one eggshell completely with gel fluoride toothpaste and put it in one jar and then put an uncoated eggshell in the other jar. Watch for signs of decay on the uncoated eggshell and when you see them, note the condition of the eggshell you coated with toothpaste. If fluoride works, you shouldn't see any decay.</p>
<p>Follow up this demonstration by allowing the coated eggshell to remain in the vinegar to see how long it takes to start decaying.</p>
